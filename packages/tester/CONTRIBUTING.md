# Contributing

## Basic Steps

If you would like to contribute enhancements or fixes, please do the following:

1.  Fork the package repository
2.  Run `npm install` to setup all dependencies
3.  Hack on a separate topic branch created from the latest `master`. Changes to
    the package code should be made to the files in the `lib` directory.
4.  Check for lint errors with `npm test`.
5.  Commit the changes under `lib` and push the topic branch
6.  Make a pull request

## Styleguides

* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally
* When only changing documentation, include `[ci skip]` in the commit description
* Consider starting the commit message with an applicable emoji:
    * :gift: when adding a new feature
    * :art: `:art:` when improving the format/structure of the code
    * :racehorse: `:racehorse:` when improving performance
    * :non-potable_water: `:non-potable_water:` when plugging memory leaks

### JavaScript Styleguide

Please note that modifications should follow these coding guidelines:

*   Indent is 2 spaces
*   Code should pass the `eslint` linter
*   Vertical whitespace helps readability, donâ€™t be afraid to use it

## Releasing

Project members with push access to the repository also have the permissions
needed to release a new version.  If there have been changes to the project and
the team decides it is time for a new release, the process is to:

1. Update `CHANGELOG.md` with the planned version number and a short bulleted
list of major changes.  Include pull request numbers if applicable.
2. Commit the changelog and any `lib/` changes to master.
3. Publish a new version with `apm publish {major|minor|patch}`, using semver to
decide what type of version should be released.
4. `apm` will then automatically:
  * Update `package.json` with the new version number
  * Commit the changed `package.json` to master
  * Create a git tag for the new version and push it to GitHub
  * Publish the package to the Atom package manager
